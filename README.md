# Firmware Storage, server and client.

For uploading and storing compressed firmware binaries in ETS. Based on a production service, rewritten in Erlang and Elixir.

## Server - Storage.
Based on a service that is running in production, rewritten in Elixir.  

## Client - FirmwareUploader.
Originally called by cron job daily to aggregate new firmware files onto a single server, rewritten in Erlang.

## How to install.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Holmqvist1990/firmware_uploader.git
```

## How to start server.
Requires [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
```
$ cd storage_server
$ mix deps.get
$ iex -S mix
```

## How to run client.
Requires [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/downloads).  
Server must be running.
```
$ escript firmware_uploader.erl
```

## Sequence of operations.
```
1. Server starts two GenServers:
    - HTTP REST API via `plug_cowboy` (`lib/storage/storage/router.ex`).
    - ETS cache (`lib/storage/storage/firmware_cache.ex`).
    
Supervisor strategy is one_for_one, as corruption in one should not interfere with the other.  
This is especially true for the REST API, as it is stateless.

2. ETS loads three files into memory, for two customers:
    - "example" -> [example_1_0_0.zip, example_1_0_1.zip]
    - "another" -> [another_1_0_0.zip]

The structure of these files in memory is of a map:
    %{:name => filename, :data => <<binary>>}

3. FirmwareUploader is run (by hand) via terminal:
    $ escript.exe firmware_uploader.erl

It determines that server is missing one firmware (`example_1_0_2.zip`) and proceeds to upload it.  
Should the program be run again (without stopping the server), no new files are uploaded.
```
